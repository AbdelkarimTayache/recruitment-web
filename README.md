# Java Recruitment Exercise

This Java exercises aims at your conceptional and problem solving skills in a real world

### Business Logic

```text
    The city of Townsville requires a new Library Management system to replace it's current paper based
    workflow.
    
    The library is attended by two groups of people - Student Members and Resident Members.
    Only Members can borrow books at the library.
    
    The students are allowed to borrow books for free for a period of one month.
    
    The residents are allowd to borrow books for a period of two monts and are charged 10 cents (0.10 eu) for each day
    they keep the book
    
    There is no penalty for returning books late, but members who have late books are not allowed to borrow new ones.
```
